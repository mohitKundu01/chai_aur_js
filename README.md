## Let, const and var 

 01) HOISTING-
     var declarations, wherever they occur in a script, are processed before any code within the script is executed. Declaring a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared. This behavior is called hoisting.
     
     Hoisting no longer works with let. If we changed var to let in the above example, it would fail with an error.

 02) When you use var, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with let 
      you can't. The following would work:

 03) Variables are case sensitive so myAge is different from myage.

 04) var keywords variables are globaly scope use anywhere but with let keyword they are   
     block scope.

  NOTE: Node.js and the V8 engine are two key components in the JavaScript runtime environment, and they work together to enable 
        server-side JavaScript development.

  V8 - V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google. It's written in C++ and is responsible for executing    
       javaScript code in a web browser or a JavaScript runtime environment like Node.js.
      
  Nodejs -  Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript 
            code outside of a web browser.
   (Working- Node.js uses the V8 engine to execute JavaScript on the server-side. It provides a set of built-in modules and 
             libraries for handling I/O operations, networking, and other tasks that are essential for server-side programming.)
